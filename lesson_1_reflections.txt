What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    pro for manually choosing: i can decide when it makes sense to commit and when not
	contra: it might be that i commit too rarely

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

i think it might be because google docs is more a text based environment, so that every document stands for its own
with code, the files are more closely interlinked

different versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

i might be less in fear of having made mistakes and messed up the code, because it would be much more easy to find them or to go back to a version before
